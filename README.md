# codefestCTF_2018

I participated in codefestCTF 2018 as [iamoddcoder](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/codefest-ctf-18/leaderboard) and finished in 17th place in the leaderboard. The entire CTF was fun and engaging(not very much guessing involved).

This writeup section consists of writeups for few of the interesting tasks
## Typing master - 50 points
## Fortune cookies - 75 points
## Prodigy - 100 points
## It's magic - 200 points
## Thunder - 250 points
## Polyglot - 300 points

## (Writeups will be added overtime. I'll just post writeups for few tasks now)
